<h1>Wordle!</h1>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>In this assignment you'll work on implementing the game 'Wordle'.  If you haven't played it, I suggest
you try it out (a google search will help you find it!) so you know what to aim for.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Playing a game of wordle can be broken down into these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>The computer obtains a list of possible words</li>
<li>The computer selects one word as the "secret" which the player will try to guess</li>
<li>The player guesses a word</li>
<li>The computer generates a hint about which letters are correct/incorrect.</li>
<li>The hint is communicated to the player.</li>
<li>Guessing continues until the player is out of turns or wins the game.</li>
</ol>
<p>The game is implemented in three classes: <code>Wordle</code>, <code>Hint</code>, and
<code>WordleGame</code>.  The <code>Wordle</code> class is responsible for items (1) and (2)
above. Both the <code>Wordle</code> class and the <code>Hint</code> class are responsible
for item (4). The <code>Wordle</code> class must be part of providing a hint to
the player since the <code>Wordle</code> class knows what the secret word
is. However, the logic for how to construct the hint itself, and the
data associated with the details of the hint are encapsulated by the
<code>Hint</code> class, so the <code>Wordle</code> class acts mainly as a middle-man. The
<code>WordleGame</code> class contains the logic for interacting between the
computer and the player. That is, it is a user of the <code>Wordle</code> and
<code>Hint</code> classes. Specifically, the <code>WordleGame</code> starts steps (1) and
(2) off by creating the <code>Wordle</code> object instance. The <code>WordleGame</code>
allows a player to guess a word (step 3) by reading input from the
keyboard, and then sends that to the computer (i.e., the <code>Wordle</code>
object instance) to obtain a hint, which is then printed for the user
(step 5).  This "game loop" continues until no more guesses remain, or
the game is won (step 6).</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>All coding takes place in the file <code>Wordle.java</code>. You should look through all the code and generally
I've tried to order the parts so that easier items are implemented first.  Without a doubt, the most
complex code live in the <code>Hint</code> constructor. Here, you'll be constructing a Hint to the puzzle. Of course
constructing a Hint requires knowing what the secret word is as well as what the guess was.  Then you'll
need to figure out what letters are correctly placed, what letters are in the secret word, but incorrectly
placed, and what letters aren't in the secret word at all.  Read the comments for the constructor for more
details.</p>
<p>I suggest you implement this with a series of stages. First determining which characters are correctly placed
then checking which are incorrectly placed, and finally determining which are not in the puzzle. Each stage
will require some looping.</p>
<p>Further there are a number of ways to create the Strings that will eventually become hint's instance
variables. Here are some options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build Strings by concatenating smaller Strings with the + operator.</li>
<li>Build Strings from char arrays.</li>
<li>Build Strings using the StringBuilder class.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>At the top of the Hint constructor</em>, you should provide a comment that provides reasoning/justification for
the method you've used to build the Strings each Hint instance uses. You may use any of the approaches I've
listed above, some combination of those, or alternate methods.</p>
<h2>Grading</h2>
<ul>
<li>30 points for testing via Autolab</li>
<li>15 points for general style/approach as evaluated by the TA</li>
<li>10 points for the reasoning and justification for your method of constructing Hint instances as described in your comments</li>
</ul>
